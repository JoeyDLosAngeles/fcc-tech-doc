                <p>Back in 2009 I took 2 semesters of HTML/CSS classes. This was the bad old days that a site like 
                    <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a>
                would light up like a christmas tree of colors on who allowed what css techniques. I remember that my professor would
                check your site on I.E. Chrome, Firefox and Safari. By all means I’m not saying some of those issues don’t still happen
                but they’ve gotten worlds better. <br><br>
                As I am refreshing my knowledge of HTML/CSS the first thing that blew my mind away was Flexbox. Back when I first
                learned HTML/CSS all positioning was done with positioning. Absolute, Relative, Static, Fixed, Inherit. This wasn’t easy
                because what looked great in chrome looked horrible in IE. and lining stuff up was a task. Flexbox seems like such an
                amazing solution to so many of these tasks.</p>
                <img src="img/position.jpg" alt="Examples of HTML/CSS position">
                <p>Flexbox is a single dimensional layout model that helps you easily align and space elements across your page. You layout
                either in a row or a column. More complex layout can be handled with a grid (also awesome). If you use them together,
                Pow, it’s a powerhouse.</p>

                <header><h2>Two Axis of Flexbox</h2></header>
                <p>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is
                defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox
                refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.</p>

                <div class="main-axis">
                <h3>The main axis</h3>
                <p>The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>row</li>
                            <li>row-reverse</li>
                            <li>column</li>
                            <li>column-reverse</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.</p>
                        <img src="img/axis-row.jpg" alt="graphic showing main axis row">
                        <p>Choose column or column-reverse and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the block
                        direction.</p>
                        <img src="img/axis-column.jpg" alt="Graphic showing main axis column">

                <div class="cross-axis">
                        <h3>The cross axis</h3>
                        <p>The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or
                        row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns.</p>
                        <img src="img/cross-axis-row.jpg" alt="graphic displaying cross axis row">
                        <p>If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.</p>

                        <p>Understanding which axis is which is important when we start to look at aligning and justifying flex items; flexbox
                        features properties that align and justify content along one axis or the other.</p>

                <header><h2>The Flex Container</h2></header>
                <p>An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex container, we set the value of
                the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do this the direct children of that
                container become flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex
                container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row).</li>
                    <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
                    <li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li>
                    <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
                    <li>The flex-basis property is set to auto.</li>
                    <li>The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main
                axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items
                are taller than others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.<br><br>
                You can see in the example below how this looks.</p>

                    <h3>Changing flex-direction</h3>
                    <p>Adding the <code>flex-direction</code> property to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items
                    display. Setting <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code> will keep the items displaying along the row, however the start and end
                    lines are switched.<br><br>
                    
                    If we change <code>flex-direction</code> to column the main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set column-reverse
                    and the start and end lines are again switched.<br><br>
                    
                    The example below has <code>flex-direction</code> set to row-reverse.</p>

                <header><h2>Multi-line flex containers with flex-wrap</h2></header>
                <p>While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause our flex items to wrap onto multiple lines. In doing
                so, you should consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will happen across that line, without
                reference to the lines either side.<br><br>
                
                To cause wrapping behavior add the property <code>flex-wrap </code> with a value of wrap. Now, should your items be too large to all
                display in one line, they will wrap onto another line. The sample below contains items that have been given a
                width, the total width of the items being too wide for the flex container. As flex-wrap is set to wrap, the items wrap.
                Set it to nowrap, which is also the initial value, and they will instead shrink to fit the container because they are
                using initial flexbox values that allows items to shrink. Using nowrap would cause an overflow if the items were not
                able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.</p>

                <header><h2>Properties applied to flex items</h2></header>
                <p>To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We do this by way of three properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>flex-grow</code></li>
                    <li><code>flex-shrink</code></li>
                    <li><code>flex-basis</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of available space. What we are doing when
                we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items.
                This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.<br><br>
                
                If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our
                items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don’t change the initial values then flexbox will
                put that space after the last item.</p>

                <img src="img/properties-flex-items.jpg" alt="Graphic about flex items properties">

                <p>If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the
                leftover space between the items. This is what the flex properties that we apply to the items themselves, will do.</p>
                <div id="flex-basis">
                    <h2>The flex-basis property</h2>
                    <p>The <code>flex-basis</code> is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial
                    value of this property is auto — in this case the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above,
                    all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the </code>flex-basis</code>.<br><br>
                    
                    If the items don’t have a size then the content's size is used as the <code>flex-basis</code>. This is why when we just declare
                    display: flex on the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need
                    to display their contents.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="flex-grow">
                    <h2>The flex-grow property</h2>
                    <p>With the <code>flex-grow</code> property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main axis from their <code>flex-basis</code>.
                    This will cause the item to stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or a proportion of the available space
                    if other items are allowed to grow too.<br><br>
                    
                    If we gave all of our items in the example above a <code>flex-grow</code> value of 1 then the available space in the flex container
                    would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.<br><br>
                    
                    The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a <code>flex-grow</code> value of 2
                    and the other items a value of 1, 2 parts will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example
                    above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).</p>
                </div>
                <div id="flex-shrink">
                    <h2>The flex-shrink property</h2>
                    <p>Where the <code> flex-grow </code> property deals with adding space in the main axis, the<code> flex-shrink </code>property controls how it is taken
                    away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items and <code>flex-shrink</code>is set to a positive integer
                    the item can become smaller than the <code>flex-basis</code>. As with flex-grow different values can be assigned in order to cause
                    one item to shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for <code>flex-shrink</code> will shrink faster than its
                    siblings that have lower values.<br><br>
                    
                    The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will
                    happen, which means that <code>flex-shrink</code> has the potential to appear less consistent than <code>flex-grow</code>in behavior.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div id="SH-flex-properties">
                    <h2>Shorthand values for the flex properties</h2>
                    <p>You will very rarely see the <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and flex-basis properties used individually; instead they are
                    combined into the flex shorthand. The flex shorthand allows you to set the three values in this order — flex-grow,
                    flex-shrink, flex-basis.<br><br>
                        
                    The example below allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value
                    is flex-grow. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is flex-shrink — with a positive value
                    the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is flex-basis; this is the
                    value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.</p>

                    <img src="img/shorthand-flex-properties.jpg" alt="Graphic explaining shorthand flex properties.">

<pre><code>
.box {

.one {
flex: 3 4 auto;

.two {
flex: 1 1 auto;

&lt;div class=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

                    <p>There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see these used in
                    tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>flex: initial</code></li>
                        <li><code>flex: auto</code></li>
                        <li><code>flex: none</code></li>
                        <li><code>flex: &lt;positive-number&gt;</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Setting <code>flex: initial</code> resets the item to the initial values of Flexbox. This is the same as <code> 
                    flex: 0 1 auto</code>. In this case the value of <code>flex-grow</code>is 0, so items will not grow larger than their
                    <code>flex-basis</code> size. The value of <code>flex-shrink</code> is 1, so
                    items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The value of <code>flex-basis</code> is <code> auto </code>. 
                    Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension, or they will get their size from the content size.<br><br>
                        
                    Using <code>flex: auto</code> is the same as using <code>flex: 1 1 auto;</code> everything is as with <code>flex:initial</code> but in this case the items can
                    grow and fill the container as well as shrink if required.<br><br>
                        
                    Using <code>flex: none</code>will create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote <code> flex: 0 0 auto</code>. The items cannot grow or
                    shrink but will be laid out using flexbox with a <code>flex-basis</code>of <code>auto</code>.<br><br>
                        
                    The shorthand you often see in tutorials is <code>flex: 1</code> or <code>flex: 2</code>and so on. This is as if you used <code>flex: 1 1 0</code>. The items
                    can grow and shrink from a <code>flex-basis</code> of 0.</p>

                <header><h2>Alignment, justification and distribution of free space between items</h2></header>
                <p>A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space
                between flex items.</p>

            <div id="align-items">
                    <h3>align-items</h3>
                    <p>The <code>align-items</code> property will align the items on the cross axis.<br><br>
                    
                    The initial value for this property is <code>stretch</code> and this is why flex items stretch to the height of the tallest one by
                    default. They are in fact stretching to fill the flex container — the tallest item is defining the height of that.<br><br>
                    
                    You could instead set <code>align-items</code> to <code>flex-start</code>in order to make the items line up at the start of the flex container,
                    <code>flex-end</code> to align them to the end, or <code>center</code> to align them in the centre. Try this example — I have given
                    the flex container a height in order that you can see how the items can be moved around inside the container. See what
                    happens if you set the value of <code>align-items</code> to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>stretch</code></li>
                        <li><code>flex-start</code></li>
                        <li><code>flex-end</code></li>
                        <li><code>center</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="img/align-items-flex-container.jpg" alt="graphic showing align items">

<pre><code>
.box {
display: flex;
align-items: flex-start;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Three
&lt;br&gt;has
&lt;br&gt;extra
&lt;br&gt;text
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
            </div>
                <div id="justify-content">
                    <h3>justify-content</h3>
                    <p>The <code>justify-content</code> property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which <code>flex-direction</code> has set
                    the flow. The initial value is <code>flex-start</code>which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could
                    also set the value to <code>flex-end</code>to line them up at the end, or <code>center</code> to line them up in the centre.<br><br>
                    
                    You can also use the value <code>space-between</code> to take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it
                    out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each item. To cause an equal amount of
                    space on the right and left of each item use the value <code>space-around</code>. With <code>space-around</code>, items have a half-size space on
                    either end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the value <code>space-evenly</code>. With <code>space-evenly</code>, items have
                    a full-size space on either end.<br><br>
                    
                    Try the following values of <code>justify-content</code> in the example:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>flex-start</code></li>
                        <li><code>flex-end</code></li>
                        <li><code>center</code></li>
                        <li><code>space-around</code></li>
                        <li><code>space-between</code></li>
                        <li><code>space-evenly</code></li>
                    </ul>
