            <h2>Hey, you flexing?</h2>
            <p>Back in 2009 I took 2 semesters of HTML/CSS classes. This was the bad old days that a site like <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> 
            would light up like a christmas tree of colors on who allowed what css techniques. I remember that my professor would
            check your site on I.E. Chrome, Firefox and Safari. By all means I’m not saying some of those issues don’t still happen
            but they’ve gotten worlds better.<br>
            As I am refreshing my knowledge of HTML/CSS the first thing that blew my mind away was Flexbox. Back when I first
            learned HTML/CSS all positioning was done with positioning. Absolute, Relative, Static, Fixed, Inherit. This wasn’t easy
            because what looked great in chrome looked horrible in IE. and lining stuff up was a task. Flexbox seems like such an
            amazing solution to so many of these tasks.<br>
            Flexbox is a single dimensional layout model that helps you easily align and space elements across your page. You layout
            either in a row or a column. More complex layout can be handled with grid (also awesome). If you use them together, Pow,
            it’s a powerhouse.</p>

        <section id="Axes">
            <h2>Axis of Power!</h2>
            <p>The base of Flex is flex-direction: with flex-direction you have 4 properties to choose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>row</li>
                <li>column</li>
                <li>row-reverse</li>
                <li>column-reverse</li>
            </ul>
            <P>Row and or row reverse run horizontally. Column and or column reverse run vertically. So row or row reverse run like it
            would if you were to use display: inline (left to right).</P>
            <code></code>
            <p>For columns or column-reverse it would run as if you used
            display: block (top to bottom).</P>
            <code></code>
